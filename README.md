## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using flexbox to align the 3 columns side by side.
- Using button outline to create the hover effect on the card buttons
- Using outline-offset css property to make the button border appear on the inside of the button on hover.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning css outline property as well as using the outline-offset property.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline) - different css outline styles
